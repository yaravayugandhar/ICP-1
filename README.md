# ICP-1

# Web Programming- In Class Programming(ICP) - 1

***

## In this ICP we are going to install WebStorm IDE,create sample project in Visul Studio Code and also work on GitHub operations such as creating repositories, creating branches, creating pull requests, commit the changes, pushing the changes to remote git repository, merging branches with the master, creating issues in git, Forking the repositories and so on.

1. Show that you have VS Code installed on your machine
The below screen shots shows that VS Code was installed on my System:

2. Create a GitHub account. Create a repository in remote GitHub. Clone it to the local machine. Created directories in local GitHub
I already have an account on GitHub. Created a repository with the name "ICP-1".

Next I have cloned the repository into my local machine by using GitBash command-line interface for GitHub.

3. Take screenshots of a repository creation and put them in the documentation folder in the local repository and sync it to the remote repository

Here I have copied some of the images into the Images folder in the local repository and then I have committed the changes and then pushed them to remote repository by using the GiTBash command prompt.

4. Create an HTML document named "index.html" and place it in the source folder
Created index.html file in source folder by using VS Code IDE and then committed and pushed the changes to the remote repository.

5. Write about your repository in README.MD file
In this step I wrote some stuff regarding the repository in README.MD file as shown in below screenshot

6. Create a wiki page for your first ICP1 and explain what you did in your first ICP (use the screenshots took in step3)
In this step, created wiki page in the WebMobileProgramming repository for ICP 1. The wiki page which is displayed now is created.

7. Create a branch for your repo and make a pull request
* Created a branch for my repository from master branch, then pushed the created branch to remote repository.
* Bellow are the screenshots for the above procedure.

Shifted to first_branch from main branch using git commands, below are the screenshots for the same.

Made some changes locally in the created branched, then pushed the changes and merged the changes to the master.
